# Staged

Purpose
- Tasks here are curated and ready to implement.
- Each task should be atomic, self‑contained, and include clear acceptance criteria and evidence expectations.

How to Use
- Create a new task file using the naming convention `NN-title.task.md` (e.g., `41-root-readme-refactor.task.md`).
- Author the task using the template sections:
  - Context, Intent
  - Files (Create/Update/Delete)
  - Per-file Changes (exact)
  - Implementation Steps
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Evidence/Proof
- When you start implementing, move the task to In‑Progress (or link to it from a PR).

Recommended Checklist (inside each task file)
- [ ] All target files and exact changes listed
- [ ] Links validated (relative paths)
- [ ] Tests/reports (if relevant) run clean
- [ ] Evidence attached (screenshots, diffs, output)
- [ ] Commit message finalized

Links
- Task Template: ../../project/_TEMPLATE.task.md (created in Task 46)
