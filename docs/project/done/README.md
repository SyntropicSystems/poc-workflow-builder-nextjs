# Done

Purpose
- Archive of completed tasks with evidence.
- Serves as the historical record of what was implemented and why.

How to Use
- When a task meets all Acceptance Criteria and evidence is attached, move it here from `../in-progress`.
- Keep the final task document intact, including:
  - Acceptance Criteria (all checked)
  - Evidence/Proof (screenshots, diffs, CLI outputs, links)
  - Any relevant PR/commit links or references
- Do not rewrite history; if follow‑ups are needed, create a new staged task and link back here.

Evidence & Provenance
- Prefer colocated artifacts:
  - Screenshot(s) and/or proof markdown alongside the task file or in a subfolder.
  - Links to PRs/commits for traceability.
- If automated reports validate the change, reference the report and timestamp/commit.

Browsing Tips
- Tasks are organized by numbered prefixes (e.g., `31-*`, `32-*`) and may be grouped into subfolders.
- Read the original task file first for context, then review attached evidence.

Links
- In‑Progress: ../in-progress/README.md
- Staged: ../staged/README.md
- Docs Index: ../../README.md
