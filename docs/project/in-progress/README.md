# In‑Progress

Purpose
- Track tasks that are currently being executed.
- Provide visibility into active work, status, and associated branches/PRs/commits.

How to Use
- Move a curated task from `../staged` into this folder (or reference it here with a link) when work begins.
- In the task document:
  - Add a short “Status” section and keep it up to date (e.g., “editing docs…”, “awaiting review”).
  - Link the working branch or PR (if applicable).
  - Record notable decisions or deviations from the original plan.
  - Check off Acceptance Criteria as they are met.
- When all Acceptance Criteria are satisfied and evidence is attached, move the task to `../done`.

Recommended Status Block (inside each task)
- Status: In progress / Blocked / Ready for review
- Branch/PR: link to branch and/or PR (if applicable)
- Commits: short log or key SHAs (optional)
- Next step: 1–2 bullets

Links
- Staged Tasks: ../staged/README.md
- Done: ../done/README.md
- Docs Index: ../../README.md
