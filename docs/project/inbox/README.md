# Inbox

Purpose
- Collect raw, untriaged ideas, notes, and potential improvements.
- Serve as the starting point before grooming items into atomic tasks.

How to Use
- Add brief notes or links; keep each idea scoped to a single concern where possible.
- Promote an item to “Staged” when:
  - The intent is clear and focused (atomic scope).
  - A concrete outcome is defined.
  - Acceptance criteria are identified.
  - Per‑file changes are reasonably known.
- When promoting, convert the idea into a proper task document in `../staged` using the template.

Links
- Task Template: ../../project/_TEMPLATE.task.md (created in Task 46)
- Staged Tasks: ../staged/README.md
- Docs Index: ../../README.md
